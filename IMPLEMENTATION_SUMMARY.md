# Implementation Summary: Candidate Signup and Job Posting

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of two major features:
1. **Candidate Signup with Candidate Details** - Updated signup process to handle candidates who don't have organizations
2. **Job Posting System** - Complete job posting functionality for recruiters

## Database Schema Changes

### Updated Models
- **User Model**: Made `organizationId` optional to support candidates without organizations
- **CandidateDetails Model**: Already existed, now properly integrated with candidate signup
- **Organization Model**: Added relationship to job posts

### New Models
- **JobPost Model**: Complete job posting model with all required fields
  - Basic job information (name, slug, openings, experience requirements)
  - Salary information (min/max annual salary, currency, salary type)
  - Location information (city, locality, country, state, address)
  - Job details (skills, category, description, specialization)
  - Application settings (enable form, application URL, shared image)
  - Status and metadata (posting status, creation/update tracking)
  - Relationships to User and Organization

## API Endpoints Added

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/auth/candidate/signup` - Candidate registration with details
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Universal login for both recruiters and candidates

### Job Posting Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/jobs` - Create new job post (recruiter only)
- `GET /api/v1/jobs` - Get all job posts with pagination
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/:id` - Get job post by ID
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/slug/:slug` - Get job post by slug
- `PUT /api/v1/jobs/:id` - Update job post (creator or admin only)
- `DELETE /api/v1/jobs/:id` - Delete job post (creator or admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/search` - Search job posts
- `GET /api/v1/organizations/:organizationId/jobs` - Get jobs by organization
- `GET /api/v1/user/jobs` - Get jobs by current user (recruiter)
- `GET /api/v1/user/jobs/stats` - Get job posting statistics

## Business Logic Implementation

### Candidate Signup Process
1. **Validation**: Validates candidate registration input including candidate details
2. **User Creation**: Creates user record with `userType: 'CANDIDATE'` and no organization
3. **Candidate Details**: Creates candidate details record in a transaction
4. **Email Verification**: Sends verification email
5. **Authentication**: Returns JWT token for immediate login

### Job Posting System
1. **Authorization**: Only recruiters can create job posts
2. **Organization Requirement**: Recruiters must be associated with an organization
3. **Slug Generation**: Automatic slug generation from job name
4. **Permission Control**: Only job creator or organization admin can update/delete
5. **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across job fields
6. **Statistics**: Job posting analytics for organizations

## Validation Schemas

### Candidate Registration
- Email and password validation
- Required personal information (first name, last name)
- Optional candidate details (skills, experience, portfolio links, etc.)

### Job Posting
- Required job information (name, openings, experience, salary)
- Location and category validation
- Salary range validation (min ≤ max)
- Experience range validation (min ≤ max)

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RECRUITER vs CANDIDATE)
- Organization-level permissions for job management
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Protection
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Email verification system
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Security headers with Helmet

## File Structure Changes

### New Files Created
- `src/services/job.service.ts` - Job posting business logic
- `src/controllers/job.controller.ts` - Job posting HTTP handlers
- `src/routes/job.routes.ts` - Job posting route definitions

### Updated Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added JobPost model and updated relationships
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added job posting and candidate interfaces
- `src/types/validation.ts` - Added validation schemas
- `src/services/auth.service.ts` - Added candidate signup method
- `src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - Added candidate signup endpoint
- `src/routes/auth.routes.ts` - Added candidate signup route
- `src/routes/index.ts` - Added job routes export
- `src/app.ts` - Added job routes to main application

## Usage Examples

### Candidate Signup
```json
POST /api/v1/auth/candidate/signup
{
  "email": "candidate@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "candidateDetails": {
    "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
    "location": "New York, NY",
    "skills": "JavaScript, React, Node.js",
    "experience": "3 years of full-stack development",
    "resumeUrl": "https://example.com/resume.pdf",
    "desiredJobTitle": "Senior Frontend Developer",
    "preferredWorkLocation": "Remote",
    "salaryExpectation": 80000
  }
}
```

### Job Posting
```json
POST /api/v1/jobs
{
  "name": "Senior Frontend Developer",
  "numberOfOpenings": 2,
  "minimumExperience": 3,
  "maximumExperience": 7,
  "minAnnualSalary": 70000,
  "maxAnnualSalary": 120000,
  "jobSkill": "React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS",
  "jobCategory": "Frontend Development",
  "city": "New York",

}
```

## Database Migration
- Migration file: `20250731044330_add_job_post_model`
- Applied successfully with Prisma
- Database schema now in sync with code

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Documentation**: Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
3. **Frontend Integration**: Create frontend components for job posting and candidate signup
4. **Advanced Features**: Add job application system, interview scheduling, etc.
5. **Performance**: Add caching and database query optimization
6. **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring and logging

## Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Follows existing code patterns and architecture
- Implements proper error handling and logging
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Follows RESTful API design principles
